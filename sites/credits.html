	About site: <br>
	My personal website. Based on my friend Erik's old HSU website. The site this was originally based on does not exist anymore. <br>
	About me:  <br>
	Hi! I am SvGaming. My hobby is building PCs and sometimes programming. <br>
	I also have a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SvGaming234">Reddit account</a> and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCATqFRa7-T4BcqqNnW_TBfw/featured">YouTube channel.</a> <br>
	I also make games in Roblox. More info on them is in the "Projects" section of the site.<br>
	Credits: <br>
	My friend Erik for the base website code. <br>
