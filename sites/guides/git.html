        Hello everyone! Today I will be teaching you some basics of using Git. <br>
        What is Git? <br>
        Git is a collaboration tool for writing code with your friends or colleagues. <br>
        Programs on Git are in repositories (repos) that can be hosted on various sites such as GitHub. <br>
        Well, how do I use it? <br>
        To start off, you can try cloning a reopository. <br>
        To clone a repository, type: git clone *repository URL* <br>
        To make a repo, you need to go to your Git hosting site of choice (usually GitHub or GitLab) and make a repository there. <br>
        After that you can clone it as shown above. <br>
        Next you can make some changes such as creating/deleting or editing files and then you can upload the changes with these commands: <br>
        git add . <br> git commit -m "*summary of changes*" <br> git push origin *branch name* <br> A deafult branch name is most likely master or main. <br>
        Made any changes on another computer? Type git pull to pull the changes onto your computer. <br>
        Thanks for following my tutorial! I might continue the tutorial and explain how to merge changes. <br>
