        Hello! In this guide i will be showing you how to set up OBS studio for recording. <br>
        Step 1: Installing OBS studio <br>
        To start using OBS studio, you of course have to install it first. <br>
        Downloading and installing on Windows: <br>
        Go to <a href="https://obsproject.com/">https://obsproject.com/</a> and click "Windows" to download the Windows version. <br>
        <img id= "obsimg" src="../../images/guides/obsimg/obsimg1.png" alt="obsimg1"> <br>
        After the download is complete, run the setup program you just downloaded, and follow the install process. <br>
        After that, you are done installing! Feel free to move on to the next step. <br>
        Downloading and installing on Linux: <br>
        Debian and Debian-based distros: (Ubuntu, Mint, etc.)
        Open the terminal and type "sudo apt update && sudo apt install obs-studio -y", and type your user password. <br>
        <img id= "obsimg" src="../../images/guides/obsimg/obsimg2.png" alt="obsimg2"> <br>
        Arch or Arch based distros (Manjaro, EndavourOS, etc.) <br>
        Open the terminal and type "sudo pacman -S obs-studio", and type in your user password. <br>
        After that, you are done installing! Feel free to move on to the next step. <br>
        <img id= "obsimg" src="../../images/guides/obsimg/obsimg4.png" alt="obsimg4"> <br>
        Step 2: Setting it up <br>
        To start setting OBS up, you have to run OBS. <br>
        To run it, just double click it. <br>
        <img id= "obsimg" src="../../images/guides/obsimg/obsimg3.png" alt="obsimg3"> <br>
        After running OBS, you will be greeted with this screen. <br>
        <img id= "obsimg" src="../../images/guides/obsimg/obsimg5.png" alt="obsimg5"> <br>
        Click "Optimise just for recording, I will not be streaming", and then click "Next". <br>
        After that, this screen will pop up. <br>
        <img id= "obsimg" src="../../images/guides/obsimg/obsimg6.png" alt="obsimg6"> <br>
        I recommend leaving these options at deafult and just clicking "Next". <br>
        After that, click "Apply settings". <br>
        You should now be able to add a source. I recommend adding the "Display Capture" source to capture your display. <br>
        You can do that by cilcking the little "+" icon next to the Sources window, clicking "Display Capture", and clicking OK. <br>
        <img id= "obsimg" src="../../images/guides/obsimg/obsimg7.png" alt="obsimg7"> <br>
        <img id= "obsimg" src="../../images/guides/obsimg/obsimg8.png" alt="obsimg8"> <br>
        When you complete those steps, you should see this screen. <br>
        <img id= "obsimg" src="../../images/guides/obsimg/obsimg9.png" alt="obsimg9"> <br>
        I recommend leaving all the settings at deafult, and clicking OK, if you only have 1 monitor. <br>
        If you have more than 1 monitor, you can select which monitor you would like to capture here. <br>
        After that, you should be ready for some basic recording! <br>
        If you don't want to be heard in your video, press the icon shown in the image below to mute your microfone. <br>
        <img id= "obsimg" src="../../images/guides/obsimg/obsimg10.png" alt="obsimg10"> <br>
        To start or stop recording, press the "Start Recording" or "Stop Recording" buttons of course. <br>
        To view your recordings go to File > Show recordings. <br>
        That's about it for this tutorial for now! I may add instrtuctions on how to set up your webcam in OBS later. Bye! <br>
