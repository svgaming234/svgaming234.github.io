        K3b is a very good utility for burning, ripping and doing all kinds of things with optical media made by KDE. <br>
        It's not the most maintained utiltity, but it is useful nonetheless. <br>

        nheko is an advanced and super customizable client for the chat platform called Matrix. <br>
        It currently lacks a bit of polish but if you are an advanced user and you don't mind it, I highly recommend it. <br>
